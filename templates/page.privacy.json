DIGITAL MILLENIUM COPYRIGHT ACT<\/strong><br\/>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides procedures for copyright owners to follow if they believe in good faith that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you have such a good faith belief with respect to any content posted on the Site, you or your agent should contact Emma in a writing clearly identified as a “Notification of Claimed Infringement.” That writing should describe the alleged infringement and request that the allegedly infringing content be removed (or that access to it be blocked). A “Notice of Claimed Infringement” must include the following information:<\/p><p>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the works that have been allegedly infringed;<\/p><p>Identification of the copyrighted work alleged to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);<\/p><p>Identification of the specific material alleged to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Emma to locate the material on the Site;<\/p><p>Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address (to the extent available);<\/p><p>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.<\/p><p>If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been improperly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Emma a counter-notice describing why you have that belief.<\/p><p>Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http:\/\/www.loc.gov\/copyright\/ for details.<\/p><p>Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent to https:\/\/www.emma-mattress.com\/contacts\/ . We recommend that you obtain professional legal advice before filing a notice or counter-notice under the DMCA. The DMCA imposes penalties for false claims made under it.<\/p><p><strong>XII.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION; CHOICE OF LAW; MANDATORY ARBITRATION<\/strong><br\/>We hope and expect that we will never have a dispute with you. However, if a dispute, claim, or controversy does arises from these Terms, the Site, or your purchase of Products or use of any service available via the Site, the following rules and procedures shall apply.<\/p><p>Informal Dispute Resolution. Both parties (You and Emma Mattress,Inc.) both agree that you will try in good faith to resolve any dispute informally. If you wish to initiate this informal process, you must send a notice clearly marked “Notice of Dispute,” and have it contain a brief yet detailed written statement clarifying your name, address, and contact information, the information pertaining to your dispute, and the resolution you are seeking. All notices must be sent to support@emma-mattress.com. We will contact you via email at the address that you have specified in your notice or at the physical address we have on file relating to any order you placed with us. Both parties (You and Emma Mattress, Inc.) agree to use reasonable, good faith efforts to settle any Dispute through consultation, communication, and negotiations within thirty (30) days of your submission of a formal notice. If a dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days of it being formally submitted, either party may resort to the procedures described in the remainder of this section. If Emma Mattress INC has a dispute with you, they will follow the same procedure, except with the one caveat that they will initiate the process by sending the “Notice of Dispute” to you via email at the address specified in any such notice or the physical address we have on file relating to any order you placed with us.<\/p><p>Mandatory Arbitration. In the event that you and Emma Mattress INC are unable to resolve a dispute through informal negotiation within thirty (30) days of the “Notice of Dispute” (as described above), both parties (You and Emma Mattress, Inc.) agree to resolve the dispute through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under “Exceptions” below, and unless you have opted-out of this agreement to arbitration by following the procedure described below.<\/p><p>Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate<\/p><p>You can decline this agreement to arbitrate within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Site or the date on which you purchased an Emma Product (whichever is later) by contacting support@emma-mattress.com in written form (including via email) clearly marked with the subject stating “Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate” that states that you decline this arbitration agreement.<\/p><p>If you do not choose to opt out, both parties (you and Emma Mattress, Inc.) agree to submit to the personal and exclusive arbitration of any disputes arising out of or relating to your use of the Site under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The AAA Rules and fee information are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.<\/p><p>Either be held in the county in the United States where you live or work, or in Delaware, unless both parties (You and Emma Mattress, Inc.) otherwise agree in writing. You may not, and you promise not to, initiate any legal action or proceeding against Emma Mattress INC (including its employees, officers, agents, advisors, and sister companies) in any other forum or location.<\/p><p>Emma Mattress INC will reimburse all filing and arbitration fees for claims of less than $75,000 unless the arbitrator determines that a claim is frivolous or was brought in bad faith or for an improper purpose. You are responsible for any other costs that you may incur in connection with the arbitration, including but not limited to attorney's fees and expert witness costs, unless Emma Mattress INC is otherwise specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law. For claims that total more than $75,000, the AAA Rules shall govern payment of filing fees and arbitration fees. Both parties (You and Emma Mattress , Inc.) agree not to seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that a claim is frivolous or was brought in bad faith or for an improper purpose.<\/p><p>You agree that you may resolve any dispute with Emma Mattress INC only on an inpidual basis, and that you may not bring any claim or demand as a plaintiff of, or otherwise participate as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative action or proceeding. Further, unless both parties (You and Emma Mattress INC) otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class, consolidated or representative proceeding. Therefore, you acknowledge and understand that each of the following restrictions applies to any Dispute you have with Emma Mattress INC (including its employees, officers, agents, and advisors) arising out of or relating to your use of the Site, purchase of any Products, or these Terms:<\/p><p>BOTH PARTIES (YOU AND EMMA MATTRESS, Inc.) HEREBY EXPRESS WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL<\/p><p>YOU ARE WAIVING AND GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS IN ANY LAWSUIT INVOLVING ANY SUCH DISPUTE<\/p><p>If any court or arbitrator determines that the class, consolidated, or representative action waiver set forth in this section is void or unenforceable for any reason or that arbitration may proceed on a class, consolidated, or representative basis, then the Dispute will not be subject to arbitration and, other than small claims actions, must be brought in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction in Dover Delaware (Kent County). Both parties (you and Emma Mattress, Inc.) irrevocably consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there and waive all objections to venue or personal jurisdiction there (except for objections based on failure of service of process). Both parties (You and Emma Mattress, Inc.) also each agree to waive our right to a jury trial in these circumstances.<\/p><p>Exceptions. Either you or Emma Mattress INC may bring a lawsuit for injunctive relief to prevent and\/or to stop (1) unauthorized use or abuse of the Site, (2) defamation, libel, or other false or misleading statements, or (3) any actual or threatened intellectual property infringement or unfair competition without first engaging in the informal dispute resolution and arbitration processes described above.<\/p><p>Choice of Law. These Terms and the relationship between you and Emma Mattress INC shall in all cases be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without reference or recourse to its choice of law or conflicts of laws principles.<\/p><p>Terms Admissible as Business Records. A printed version of these Terms (including our Privacy Policy and our 365-Night Trial Policy and Limited Warranty) and of any other communications between the two parties (You and Emma Mattress, Inc.) shall be fully admissible in any proceedings arising out of or relating to these Terms, and shall be treated as a record maintained in the ordinary course of Emma Mattress INC’s business.<\/p><p><strong>XIV. OUR RIGHT TO TERMINATE YOUR ACCESS TO THE SITE<\/strong><br\/>Notwithstanding any of these Terms, we reserve the right, without notice or attendant liability, and in our sole discretion, to terminate your license to use this Site, and to block or prevent future access to and use of this Site for any reason or no reason.

We therefore reserve the right to update and revise these Terms at any time without specific or direct notice to you. We intend to notify you of changes by referring to the “Effective Date of Current Policy” date at the top of this page; provided, however, that we will endeavor to provide you with prior notice of any material changes that will apply to you. Your use of our website constitutes your acceptance of these Terms.<\/p><p><strong>XVI. WAIVER<\/strong><br\/>Our failure partially or fully to exercise any of our rights, or our waiver of any violation of these Terms, shall not prevent our later exercise of such right and shall not constitute or indicate our waiver of any subsequent breach. Our rights and remedies under these Terms and any other applicable agreement between you and us shall be cumulative, and the exercise of any such right or remedy shall not limit our right to exercise any other right or remedy.<\/p><p><strong>XVII. Severability<\/strong><br\/>If any of these Terms are deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that term will be severed and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining term or condition. NOTHING IN THESE TERMS WILL AFFECT ANY NON-NON-WAIVABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO YOU.<\/p><p><strong>XVIII. ENTIRE AGREEMENT<\/strong><br\/>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Emma with respect to the Site and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications relating to the Site. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.<\/p>"
